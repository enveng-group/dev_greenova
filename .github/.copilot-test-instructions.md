# Greenova Test Generation Guidelines

## Test Framework

- Use Django's built-in test framework (`django.test`)
- Organize tests by app, model, form, and view
- Follow test-driven development principles

## Test Structure

- Use `TestCase` for tests that need database access
- Use `SimpleTestCase` for tests that don't need database access
- Group related tests in test classes
- Name test classes clearly (e.g., `ObligationModelTest`, `ProjectFormTest`)
- Name test methods with `test_` prefix and descriptive names

## Django-Specific Testing

- Test models with `TestCase`, including field validation, methods, and
  constraints
- Test forms with validation, cleaned data, and error messages
- Test views with response status, templates, context, and redirects
- Test URL patterns and configurations
- Use `self.client` for view testing

## Testing Practices

- Set up test data in `setUp` method or use fixtures
- Test positive and negative cases
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions
- Test user permissions and authentication requirements
- Create isolated tests that don't depend on other tests

## Coverage Requirements

- Aim for 90%+ test coverage
- Test all model methods
- Test all form validations
- Test all view logic paths
- Test all permission checks

## Example Test Structure

```python
from django.test import TestCase
from django.urls import reverse
from greenova.obligations.models import Obligation

class ObligationModelTest(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Setup test data
        self.obligation = Obligation.objects.create(...)

    def test_obligation_creation(self):
        # Test object creation
        self.assertTrue(isinstance(self.obligation, Obligation))

    def test_obligation_str_method(self):
        # Test string representation
        self.assertEqual(str(self.obligation), "Expected string")

class ObligationViewTest(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Setup user and permissions
        self.client.login(...)

    def test_list_view(self):
        # Test list view
        response = self.client.get(reverse('obligation-list'))
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, 'obligations/obligation_list.html')
```

## Accessibility Testing

- Include tests for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Validate HTML output where relevant
- Test keyboard navigation on critical interactions

## Integration Tests

- Test interactions between different components
- Test critical user flows end-to-end
- Include authentication and authorization tests

## Performance Tests

- Test database query efficiency for list views
- Test pagination for large datasets
- Test response times for critical operations
