# Greenova Code Review Guidelines

## Core Principles Review

First check code against our fundamental principles:

- **Simplicity**: Is this the simplest possible solution to the problem?
- **Plain Text/HTML First**: Does the solution prioritize HTML and semantic
  markup?
- **Technology Priority**: Does the code follow our technology priority order?
- **Data-Oriented Programming**: Does the code use immutable data structures
  and functional approaches?
- **5S Compliance**: Does the code follow Sort, Set in Order, Shine,
  Standardize, and Sustain principles?
- **Standards Adherence**: Does the code follow strict industry standards?
- **Value Priorities**: Does the code prioritize stability, simplicity,
  minimalism, and security over performance?

## Code Quality Standards

Review code for adherence to the following standards:

- **Python**: PEP 8 compliance with strict 88 character line length limit
- **Django**: Follow Django best practices and recommended patterns
- **HTML**: Ensure semantic and accessible markup
- **CSS**: Follow maintainable Classless-CSS practices
- **JavaScript**: Use ES6+ standards when custom JS is needed

## Security Review Checklist

- Check for Django security best practices
- Validate CSRF protection on forms
- Ensure proper user permission checks
- Review SQL injection prevention in ORM usage
- Look for potential XSS vulnerabilities in templates
- Validate secure handling of user inputs
- Check for proper password storage and authentication

## Performance Review

- Optimize database queries (limit, select_related, prefetch_related)
- Review template efficiency (caching, reuse)
- Check for N+1 query problems
- Validate pagination for list views

## Accessibility Review

- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Check heading structure and semantic HTML
- Verify proper aria attributes where needed
- Ensure color contrast meets standards
- Check keyboard navigation support

## Django-Specific Checks

- Proper model relationships and constraints
- Efficient use of Django ORM
- Appropriate view implementation (CBV vs FBV)
- Form validation and error handling
- URL patterns follow best practices
- Template inheritance hierarchy
- Project structure and modularity

## Frontend Review

- HTML-first approach with semantic elements
- Classless-PicoCSS as primary styling (only use Tailwind when necessary)
- Proper hyperscript/htmx implementation
- Minimal custom JavaScript
- Mobile responsiveness
- Browser compatibility

## Testing Review

- Ensure test coverage for models, forms, and views
- Validate critical business logic testing
- Check both positive and negative test cases
- Verify test data setup is appropriate

## Documentation Review

- Check docstrings for classes, methods, and functions
- Validate inline comments for complex logic
- Ensure README and documentation are updated
- Verify proper IEEE referencing style in technical documentation
- Check heading hierarchy and document structure
- Validate all links and references
- Ensure code examples are correct and follow style guidelines
- Confirm proper use of GitHub Markdown formatting
- Check for accessibility in documentation (alt text, descriptive links)
- Verify consistent terminology and proper definition of acronyms

## Data-Oriented Programming Review

- Check for immutable data structures
- Verify separation of data and behavior
- Look for pure functions without side effects
- Confirm functional transformations over mutations

## 5S Assessment

- **Sort**: Has unnecessary code been removed?
- **Set in order**: Is code organized logically and consistently?
- **Shine**: Is the code clean, well-documented, and well-tested?
- **Standardize**: Does the code follow project patterns and practices?
- **Sustain**: Is the code designed for maintainability?

## Code Smell Detection

- Identify duplicate code
- Check for overly complex methods/functions
- Ensure proper naming conventions
- Validate function/method length
- Check for proper error handling
- Verify logging practices

## Type Checking

- Ensure type annotations are used properly
- Check mypy compliance
- Verify django-stubs usage

## Pre-merge Checklist

- All tests pass
- Code quality tools show no critical issues
- Documentation is current
- Dependencies are properly declared
- No unnecessary commented code
- Migrations are properly created and applied
