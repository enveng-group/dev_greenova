# GitHub Copilot Commit Message Guidelines

## Commit Message Structure

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

## Types

- feat: New feature
- fix: Bug fix
- docs: Documentation changes
- style: Changes that don't affect code meaning
- refactor: Code restructuring
- perf: Performance improvements
- test: Adding/modifying tests
- chore: Maintenance tasks

## Scope

- Should be the name of the Django app or module affected
- Use lowercase
- Examples: auth, models, api, core

## Subject Line Rules

- Use imperative mood ("Add" not "Added")
- Don't capitalize first letter
- No period at the end
- Maximum 50 characters
- Start with type and scope

## Body Guidelines

- Use to explain the what and why, not the how
- Wrap at 72 characters
- Leave one blank line after subject
- Use bullet points for multiple items

## Footer Rules

- Reference issues/tickets: "Fixes #123"
- Breaking changes: "BREAKING CHANGE: <description>"
- Include migration references if applicable

## Sign-off Requirements

- All commits must be signed off
- Use the following format:

```
Signed-off-by: enveng-group <164126503+enveng-group@users.noreply.github.com>
```

- Add sign-off as the last line in the commit footer

## Examples

Good:

```
feat(auth): add password reset functionality

- Implement password reset email flow
- Add token validation
- Create reset confirmation page

Fixes #456
Signed-off-by: enveng-group <164126503+enveng-group@users.noreply.github.com>
```

Bad:

```
Added some stuff and fixed bugs
```

## Python-Specific Conventions

- Include migration numbers: "Contains migration 0012"
- Reference Django version changes
- Mark dependency updates: "deps: update Django to 4.2.1"
- Note test coverage changes

## Security Considerations

- Don't include sensitive information
- Mark security fixes: "security: fix XSS vulnerability"
- Include CVE numbers when applicable

## Tips for Copilot

- Always specify the type and scope
- Keep subject line concise and clear
- Include relevant issue numbers
- Mention breaking changes explicitly
- Add migration information for database changes
- Always include the sign-off line
