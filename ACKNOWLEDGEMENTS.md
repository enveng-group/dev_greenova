## Pre-commit Hooks

The Greenova project uses modified versions of tools originally developed by
other projects:

- The `tools/pre-commit/pre-commit-wrapper.py` file is based on solutions
  discussed in the pre-commit issue
  [#1129](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/1129) and
  specifically the implementation suggested by Anthony Sottile in this
  [comment](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/1129#issuecomment-536641352).

- The `tools/pylint/gevent_checker.py` file was adapted from the Raiden Network
  project's implementation in
  [PR #4784](https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden/pull/4784).

We are grateful to these contributors and projects for sharing their solutions
which have been incorporated into our workflow.
