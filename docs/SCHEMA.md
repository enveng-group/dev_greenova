2. **Relationships**:
   To establish the relationships in the new table, you can follow these steps:

   - **Identify Primary Keys**: Ensure that each row in your table has a unique identifier. The `Obligation_Number` serves as the primary key.

   - **Define Foreign Keys**: Determine which columns will act as foreign keys to link to other tables. For example, `Accountability` and `Responsibility` could link to tables containing details about accountable and responsible parties.

   - **Create Relationships**:

     - **One-to-Many Relationship**: If one obligation can have multiple related records in another table (e.g., multiple actions or updates), you can establish a one-to-many relationship. Use the primary key from the obligations table as a foreign key in the related table.
     - **Many-to-Many Relationship**: If multiple obligations can be related to multiple entities (e.g., multiple obligations linked to multiple projects), you might need a junction table. This table will have foreign keys from both related tables to establish the many-to-many relationship.

   - **Ensure Data Integrity**: Use constraints to maintain data integrity. For example, ensure that foreign keys always reference valid primary keys in the related tables.

   - **Implement Referential Integrity**: Use database management system (DBMS) features to enforce referential integrity. This ensures that relationships between tables remain consistent.

3. **Components**:

   - The table includes various plans and approvals such as Construction Environmental Management Plan, Cultural Heritage Management Plan, Flora Management Plan, Fauna Management Plan, etc.
   - It also references several acts and regulations like the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016, Rights in Water and Irrigation Act 1914, and others.

6. **One-to-many Relationships**:

To create a one-to-many relationship in SQLite, you need to define a foreign key in the child table that references the primary key in the parent table. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

   - **Create the Parent Table**: This table will contain the primary key that will be referenced by the child table. For example, let's create a table called `Accountability` with a primary key `accountability_id`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Accountability (
    accountability_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    accountability_name TEXT
);
````

- **Create the Child Table**: This table will contain a foreign key that references the primary key in the parent table. For example, let's create a table called `Obligations` with a foreign key `Accountability` that references `accountability_id` in the `Accountability` table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Obligations (
    Obligation_Number INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    Project_Name VARCHAR(255),
    Primary_Environmental_Mechanism TEXT,
    Procedure TEXT,
    Environmental_Aspect TEXT,
    Obligation TEXT,
    Accountability INTEGER,
    Responsibility INTEGER,
    ProjectPhase TEXT,
    Action_DueDate TEXT,
    Close_Out_Date TEXT,
    Status TEXT,
    Supporting_Information TEXT,
    General_Comments TEXT,
    Compliance_Comments TEXT,
    NonConformance_Comments TEXT,
    Evidence TEXT,
    PersonEmail TEXT,
    Recurring_Obligation BOOLEAN,
    Recurring_Frequency TEXT,
    Recurring_Status TEXT,
    Recurring_Forcasted_Date TEXT,
    Inspection BOOLEAN,
    Inspection_Frequency TEXT,
    Site_or_Desktop TEXT,
    New_Control_Action_Required BOOLEAN,
    Obligation_Type TEXT,
    Gap_Analysis TEXT,
    Notes_for_Gap_Analysis TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (Accountability) REFERENCES Accountability(accountability_id)
);
```

- **Enable Foreign Key Support**: SQLite requires foreign key support to be explicitly enabled. You can do this by executing the following command:

```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
```

- **Insert Data**: Now you can insert data into the tables, ensuring that the foreign key in the child table references a valid primary key in the parent table.

```sql
-- Insert data into the Accountability table
INSERT INTO Accountability (accountability_id, accountability_name) VALUES (1, 'John Doe');

-- Insert data into the Obligations table
INSERT INTO Obligations (Obligation_Number, Project_Name, Primary_Environmental_Mechanism, Procedure, Environmental_Aspect, Obligation, Accountability, Responsibility, ProjectPhase, Action_DueDate, Close_Out_Date, Status, Supporting_Information, General_Comments, Compliance_Comments, NonConformance_Comments, Evidence, PersonEmail, Recurring_Obligation, Recurring_Frequency, Recurring_Status, Recurring_Forcasted_Date, Inspection, Inspection_Frequency, Site_or_Desktop, New_Control_Action_Required, Obligation_Type, Gap_Analysis, Notes_for_Gap_Analysis)
VALUES (1, 'Project 1', 'Mechanism 1', 'Procedure 1', 'Aspect 1', 'Obligation 1', 1, 2, 'Phase 1', '2025-01-18', '2025-01-19', 'In Progress', 'Supporting Info', 'General Comments', 'Compliance Comments', 'NonConformance Comments', 'Evidence', 'email@example.com', 1, 'Monthly', 'In Progress', '2025-02-18', 1, 'Monthly', 'Site', 1, 'Type 1', 'Gap Analysis', 'Notes for Gap Analysis');
```

By following these steps, you can create a one-to-many relationship in SQLite, ensuring that each record in the child table (`Obligations`) references a valid record in the parent table (`Accountability`). This helps maintain data integrity and ensures that the relationships between tables remain consistent.

7. **Many-to-many junction table schemas**:

To create schemas for all possible junction tables that establish many-to-many relationships based on the file, we need to identify the tables that might have many-to-many relationships. Here are some potential many-to-many relationships and their corresponding junction tables:

- **Obligations and Projects**: An obligation can be associated with multiple projects, and a project can have multiple obligations.
- **Obligations and Plans**: An obligation can be associated with multiple plans, and a plan can have multiple obligations.
- **Obligations and Regulations**: An obligation can be associated with multiple regulations, and a regulation can have multiple obligations.

Here are the schemas for the junction tables:

- **Obligations and Projects**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE ObligationProjects (
    obligation_id INTEGER,
    project_id INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (obligation_id, project_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (obligation_id) REFERENCES Obligations(Obligation_Number),
    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES Projects(project_id)
);
```

- **Obligations and Plans**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE ObligationPlans (
    obligation_id INTEGER,
    plan_id INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (obligation_id, plan_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (obligation_id) REFERENCES Obligations(Obligation_Number),
    FOREIGN KEY (plan_id) REFERENCES Plans(plan_id)
);
```

- **Obligations and Regulations**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE ObligationRegulations (
    obligation_id INTEGER,
    regulation_id INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (obligation_id, regulation_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (obligation_id) REFERENCES Obligations(Obligation_Number),
    FOREIGN KEY (regulation_id) REFERENCES Regulations(regulation_id)
);
```

To complete the schema, you would also need to define the `Projects`, `Plans`, and `Regulations` tables:

```sql
-- Create the Projects table
CREATE TABLE Projects (
    project_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    project_name TEXT,
    project_description TEXT
);

-- Create the Plans table
CREATE TABLE Plans (
    plan_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    plan_name TEXT,
    plan_description TEXT
);

-- Create the Regulations table
CREATE TABLE Regulations (
    regulation_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    regulation_name TEXT,
    regulation_description TEXT
);
```

By creating these junction tables, you can establish many-to-many relationships between the `Obligations` table and the `Projects`, `Plans`, and `Regulations` tables. This allows you to link multiple obligations to multiple projects, plans, and regulations, ensuring data integrity and consistency through foreign key constraints.

Here is how you can create a database table view for the OR(2) demonstrating the 14 days lookahead of obligations in SQLite:

1. **Create the Obligations Table**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Obligations (
    Obligation_Number INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    Project_Name VARCHAR(255),
    Primary_Environmental_Mechanism TEXT,
    Procedure TEXT,
    Environmental_Aspect TEXT,
    Obligation TEXT,
    Accountability INTEGER,
    Responsibility INTEGER,
    ProjectPhase TEXT,
    Action_DueDate DATE,
    Close_Out_Date DATE,
    Status VARCHAR(50),
    Supporting_Information TEXT,
    General_Comments TEXT,
    Compliance_Comments TEXT,
    NonConformance_Comments TEXT,
    Evidence TEXT,
    PersonEmail TEXT,
    Recurring_Obligation BOOLEAN,
    Recurring_Frequency VARCHAR(50),
    Recurring_Status VARCHAR(50),
    Recurring_Forcasted_Date DATE,
    Inspection BOOLEAN,
    Inspection_Frequency VARCHAR(50),
    Site_or_Desktop VARCHAR(50),
    New_Control_Action_Required BOOLEAN,
    Obligation_Type VARCHAR(50),
    Gap_Analysis TEXT,
    Notes_for_Gap_Analysis TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (Accountability) REFERENCES Accountability(accountability_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (Responsibility) REFERENCES Responsibility(responsibility_id)
);
```

2. **Create the Accountability Table**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Accountability (
    accountability_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    accountability_name TEXT
);
```

3. **Create the Responsibility Table**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Responsibility (
    responsibility_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    responsibility_name TEXT
);
```

4. **Enable Foreign Key Support**:

```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
```

5. **Insert Data**:

```sql
-- Insert data into the Accountability table
INSERT INTO Accountability (accountability_id, accountability_name) VALUES (1, 'John Doe');

-- Insert data into the Responsibility table
INSERT INTO Responsibility (responsibility_id, responsibility_name) VALUES (2, 'Jane Smith');

-- Insert data into the Obligations table
INSERT INTO Obligations (Obligation_Number, Project_Name, Primary_Environmental_Mechanism, Procedure, Environmental_Aspect, Obligation, Accountability, Responsibility, ProjectPhase, Action_DueDate, Close_Out_Date, Status, Supporting_Information, General_Comments, Compliance_Comments, NonConformance_Comments, Evidence, PersonEmail, Recurring_Obligation, Recurring_Frequency, Recurring_Status, Recurring_Forcasted_Date, Inspection, Inspection_Frequency, Site_or_Desktop, New_Control_Action_Required, Obligation_Type, Gap_Analysis, Notes_for_Gap_Analysis)
VALUES (1, 'Project 1', 'Mechanism 1', 'Procedure 1', 'Aspect 1', 'Obligation 1', 1, 2, 'Phase 1', '2025-01-18', '2025-01-19', 'In Progress', 'Supporting Info', 'General Comments', 'Compliance Comments', 'NonConformance Comments', 'Evidence', 'email@example.com', 1, 'Monthly', 'In Progress', '2025-02-18', 1, 'Monthly', 'Site', 1, 'Type 1', 'Gap Analysis', 'Notes for Gap Analysis');
```

6. **Create the 14 Days Lookahead View**:

```sql
CREATE VIEW FourteenDaysLookahead AS
SELECT
    Obligation_Number,
    Project_Name,
    Primary_Environmental_Mechanism,
    Procedure,
    Environmental_Aspect,
    Obligation,
    Accountability,
    Responsibility,
    ProjectPhase,
    Action_DueDate,
    Close_Out_Date,
    Status,
    Supporting_Information,
    General_Comments,
    Compliance_Comments,
    NonConformance_Comments,
    Evidence,
    PersonEmail,
    Recurring_Obligation,
    Recurring_Frequency,
    Recurring_Status,
    Recurring_Forcasted_Date,
    Inspection,
    Inspection_Frequency,
    Site_or_Desktop,
    New_Control_Action_Required,
    Obligation_Type,
    Gap_Analysis,
    Notes_for_Gap_Analysis
FROM Obligations
WHERE Action_DueDate BETWEEN DATE('now') AND DATE('now', '+14 days');
```

This view will display all obligations that have an action due date within the next 14 days. By following these steps, you can create a database table view for the OR(2) demonstrating the 14 days lookahead of obligations in SQLite.

Handling recurring obligations in the new schema involves adding specific columns to track the recurrence details and ensuring that the database can manage and query these recurring obligations effectively. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Add Columns for Recurrence Details**:

   - **Recurring_Obligation**: A boolean column to indicate if the obligation is recurring.
   - **Recurring_Frequency**: A text column to specify the frequency of the recurring obligation (e.g., Daily, Weekly, Monthly).
   - **Recurring_Status**: A text column to indicate the current status of the recurring obligation.
   - **Recurring_Forecasted_Date**: A date column to specify the forecasted date for the next occurrence of the recurring obligation.

2. **Modify the Obligations Table**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Obligations (
    Obligation_Number INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    Project_Name VARCHAR(255),
    Primary_Environmental_Mechanism TEXT,
    Procedure TEXT,
    Environmental_Aspect TEXT,
    Obligation TEXT,
    Accountability INTEGER,
    Responsibility INTEGER,
    ProjectPhase TEXT,
    Action_DueDate DATE,
    Close_Out_Date DATE,
    Status VARCHAR(50),
    Supporting_Information TEXT,
    General_Comments TEXT,
    Compliance_Comments TEXT,
    NonConformance_Comments TEXT,
    Evidence TEXT,
    PersonEmail TEXT,
    Recurring_Obligation BOOLEAN,
    Recurring_Frequency VARCHAR(50),
    Recurring_Status VARCHAR(50),
    Recurring_Forecasted_Date DATE,
    Inspection BOOLEAN,
    Inspection_Frequency VARCHAR(50),
    Site_or_Desktop VARCHAR(50),
    New_Control_Action_Required BOOLEAN,
    Obligation_Type VARCHAR(50),
    Gap_Analysis TEXT,
    Notes_for_Gap_Analysis TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (Accountability) REFERENCES Accountability(accountability_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (Responsibility) REFERENCES Responsibility(responsibility_id)
);
```

3. **Insert Data with Recurrence Details**:

```sql
-- Insert data into the Obligations table with recurrence details
INSERT INTO Obligations (Obligation_Number, Project_Name, Primary_Environmental_Mechanism, Procedure, Environmental_Aspect, Obligation, Accountability, Responsibility, ProjectPhase, Action_DueDate, Close_Out_Date, Status, Supporting_Information, General_Comments, Compliance_Comments, NonConformance_Comments, Evidence, PersonEmail, Recurring_Obligation, Recurring_Frequency, Recurring_Status, Recurring_Forecasted_Date, Inspection, Inspection_Frequency, Site_or_Desktop, New_Control_Action_Required, Obligation_Type, Gap_Analysis, Notes_for_Gap_Analysis)
VALUES (1, 'Project 1', 'Mechanism 1', 'Procedure 1', 'Aspect 1', 'Obligation 1', 1, 2, 'Phase 1', '2025-01-18', '2025-01-19', 'In Progress', 'Supporting Info', 'General Comments', 'Compliance Comments', 'NonConformance Comments', 'Evidence', 'email@example.com', 1, 'Monthly', 'In Progress', '2025-02-18', 1, 'Monthly', 'Site', 1, 'Type 1', 'Gap Analysis', 'Notes for Gap Analysis');
```

4. **Create a View for Recurring Obligations**:

```sql
CREATE VIEW RecurringObligations AS
SELECT
    Obligation_Number,
    Project_Name,
    Primary_Environmental_Mechanism,
    Procedure,
    Environmental_Aspect,
    Obligation,
    Accountability,
    Responsibility,
    ProjectPhase,
    Action_DueDate,
    Close_Out_Date,
    Status,
    Supporting_Information,
    General_Comments,
    Compliance_Comments,
    NonConformance_Comments,
    Evidence,
    PersonEmail,
    Recurring_Obligation,
    Recurring_Frequency,
    Recurring_Status,
    Recurring_Forecasted_Date,
    Inspection,
    Inspection_Frequency,
    Site_or_Desktop,
    New_Control_Action_Required,
    Obligation_Type,
    Gap_Analysis,
    Notes_for_Gap_Analysis
FROM Obligations
WHERE Recurring_Obligation = 1;
```

This view will display all recurring obligations, allowing you to easily manage and track them. By following these steps, you can effectively handle recurring obligations in the new schema, ensuring that all relevant details are captured and managed efficiently.

To update recurring obligations in the database, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Recurring Obligations**: First, identify the obligations that are recurring. These will have the `Recurring_Obligation` column set to `TRUE`.

2. **Calculate the Next Due Date**: For each recurring obligation, calculate the next due date based on the `Recurring_Frequency`. This could be daily, weekly, monthly, etc.

3. **Update the Recurring Status**: Update the `Recurring_Status` column to reflect the current status of the recurring obligation.

4. **Insert or Update Records**: Depending on your schema, you may need to insert a new record for each recurrence or update the existing record with the new due date and status.

Here is an example SQL script to update recurring obligations in SQLite:

```sql
-- Enable foreign key support
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;

-- Update the recurring obligations
UPDATE Obligations
SET
    Recurring_Status = 'In Progress',
    Recurring_Forecasted_Date = DATE(Recurring_Forecasted_Date, Recurring_Frequency)
WHERE
    Recurring_Obligation = 1
    AND Recurring_Forecasted_Date <= DATE('now');

-- Insert new records for recurring obligations if needed
INSERT INTO Obligations (
    Obligation_Number, Project_Name, Primary_Environmental_Mechanism, Procedure, Environmental_Aspect, Obligation, Accountability, Responsibility, ProjectPhase, Action_DueDate, Close_Out_Date, Status, Supporting_Information, General_Comments, Compliance_Comments, NonConformance_Comments, Evidence, PersonEmail, Recurring_Obligation, Recurring_Frequency, Recurring_Status, Recurring_Forecasted_Date, Inspection, Inspection_Frequency, Site_or_Desktop, New_Control_Action_Required, Obligation_Type, Gap_Analysis, Notes_for_Gap_Analysis
)
SELECT
    Obligation_Number, Project_Name, Primary_Environmental_Mechanism, Procedure, Environmental_Aspect, Obligation, Accountability, Responsibility, ProjectPhase, DATE(Action_DueDate, Recurring_Frequency), Close_Out_Date, 'In Progress', Supporting_Information, General_Comments, Compliance_Comments, NonConformance_Comments, Evidence, PersonEmail, Recurring_Obligation, Recurring_Frequency, 'In Progress', DATE(Recurring_Forecasted_Date, Recurring_Frequency), Inspection, Inspection_Frequency, Site_or_Desktop, New_Control_Action_Required, Obligation_Type, Gap_Analysis, Notes_for_Gap_Analysis
FROM
    Obligations
WHERE
    Recurring_Obligation = 1
    AND Recurring_Forecasted_Date <= DATE('now');
```

This script does the following:

- Enables foreign key support in SQLite.
- Updates the `Recurring_Status` and `Recurring_Forecasted_Date` for obligations that are due.
- Inserts new records for recurring obligations with the updated due date and status.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage and update recurring obligations in your database.

Here is how you can create a database table view for the OR(2) demonstrating the overdue obligations in SQLite:

1. **Create the Obligations Table**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Obligations (
    Obligation_Number INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    Project_Name VARCHAR(255),

    Gap_Analysis TEXT,
    Notes_for_Gap_Analysis TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (Accountability) REFERENCES Accountability(accountability_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (Responsibility) REFERENCES Responsibility(responsibility_id)
);
```

2. **Create the Accountability Table**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Accountability (
    accountability_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    accountability_name TEXT
);
```

3. **Create the Responsibility Table**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Responsibility (
    responsibility_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    responsibility_name TEXT
);
```

4. **Enable Foreign Key Support**:

```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
```

5. **Insert Data**:

```sql
-- Insert data into the Accountability table
INSERT INTO Accountability (accountability_id, accountability_name) VALUES (1, 'John Doe');

-- Insert data into the Responsibility table
INSERT INTO Responsibility (responsibility_id, responsibility_name) VALUES (2, 'Jane Smith');

-- Insert data into the Obligations table
INSERT INTO Obligations (Obligation_Number, Project_Name, Primary_Environmental_Mechanism, Procedure, Environmental_Aspect, Obligation, Accountability, Responsibility, ProjectPhase, Action_DueDate, Close_Out_Date, Status, Supporting_Information, General_Comments, Compliance_Comments, NonConformance_Comments, Evidence, PersonEmail, Recurring_Obligation, Recurring_Frequency, Recurring_Status, Recurring_Forecasted_Date, Inspection, Inspection_Frequency, Site_or_Desktop, New_Control_Action_Required, Obligation_Type, Gap_Analysis, Notes_for_Gap_Analysis)
VALUES (1, 'Project 1', 'Mechanism 1', 'Procedure 1', 'Aspect 1', 'Obligation 1', 1, 2, 'Phase 1', '2025-01-18', '2025-01-19', 'Overdue', 'Supporting Info', 'General Comments', 'Compliance Comments', 'NonConformance Comments', 'Evidence', 'email@example.com', 1, 'Monthly', 'In Progress', '2025-02-18', 1, 'Monthly', 'Site', 1, 'Type 1', 'Gap Analysis', 'Notes for Gap Analysis');
```

6. **Create the Overdue Obligations View**:

```sql
CREATE VIEW OverdueObligations AS
SELECT
    Obligation_Number,
    Project_Name,
    Primary_Environmental_Mechanism,
    Procedure,
    Environmental_Aspect,
    Obligation,
    Accountability,
    Responsibility,
    ProjectPhase,
    Action_DueDate,
    Close_Out_Date,
    Status,
    Supporting_Information,
    General_Comments,
    Compliance_Comments,
    NonConformance_Comments,
    Evidence,
    PersonEmail,
    Recurring_Obligation,
    Recurring_Frequency,
    Recurring_Status,
    Recurring_Forecasted_Date,
    Inspection,
    Inspection_Frequency,
    Site_or_Desktop,
    New_Control_Action_Required,
    Obligation_Type,
    Gap_Analysis,
    Notes_for_Gap_Analysis
FROM Obligations
WHERE Status = 'Overdue';
```

This view will display all obligations that are currently overdue. By following these steps, you can create a database table view for the OR(2) demonstrating the overdue obligations in SQLite.

To automate the update of overdue obligations in your database, you can create a scheduled task or a script that runs periodically to check for obligations that are past their due date and update their status accordingly. Here’s how you can do it in SQLite:

1. **Create a Script to Update Overdue Obligations**:
   - This script will check for obligations where the `Action_DueDate` is past the current date and update their status to "Overdue".

```sql
-- Enable foreign key support
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;

-- Update the status of overdue obligations
UPDATE Obligations
SET Status = 'Overdue'
WHERE Action_DueDate < DATE('now')
AND Status != 'Completed';
```

2. **Schedule the Script to Run Periodically**:
   - Depending on your operating system, you can use a task scheduler to run this script at regular intervals (e.g., daily).

**On Windows**:

- You can use Task Scheduler to run the script daily.
  1. Open Task Scheduler.
  2. Create a new task.
  3. Set the trigger to run daily.
  4. Set the action to run a program and specify the path to your SQLite script or a batch file that runs the script.

**On Linux**:

- You can use cron jobs to schedule the script.

  1. Open the crontab file by running `crontab -e`.
  2. Add a new cron job to run the script daily. For example, to run the script at midnight every day, add the following line:

     ```sh
     0 0 * * * sqlite3 /path/to/your/database.db < /path/to/your/script.sql
     ```

3. **Example of a Batch File (Windows)**:

   - Create a batch file (e.g., `update_overdue_obligations.bat`) with the following content:

     ```bat
     @echo off
     sqlite3 "C:\path\to\your\database.db" < "C:\path\to\your\script.sql"
     ```

4. **Example of a Shell Script (Linux)**:

   - Create a shell script (e.g., `update_overdue_obligations.sh`) with the following content:

     ```sh
     #!/bin/bash
     sqlite3 /path/to/your/database.db < /path/to/your/script.sql
     ```

By following these steps, you can automate the update of overdue obligations in your database. The script will run periodically, checking for obligations that are past their due date and updating their status to "Overdue". This ensures that your database remains up-to-date without manual intervention.

I attempted to clean up the OR(2) worksheet from the **[Port Project Management .xlsx](https://envenggroup-my.sharepoint.com/personal/agallo_enveng-group_com_au/Documents/Microsoft%20Copilot%20Chat%20Files/Port%20Project%20Management%20.xlsx?web=1&EntityRepresentationId=1015aa5e-e654-43c5-9704-b5a041056d11)** file and generate a CSV file for you to use as an import into SQLite. However, I encountered an issue with the worksheet name not being found.

**Getting ready to import CSV into SQLite**
Ensure that the worksheet name is correctly identified and then clean up the data accordingly. Here is the structure and columns based on the information provided:

1. **Columns**:
   - **Project_Name**
   - **Primary_Environmental_Mechanism**
   - **Procedure**
   - **Environmental_Aspect**
   - **Obligation_Number**
   - **Obligation**
   - **Accountability**
   - **Responsibility**
   - **ProjectPhase**
   - **Action_DueDate**
   - **Close_Out_Date**
   - **Status**
   - **Supporting_Information**
   - **General_Comments**
   - **Compliance_Comments**
   - **NonConformance_Comments**
   - **Evidence**
   - **PersonEmail**
   - **Recurring_Obligation**
   - **Recurring_Frequency**
   - **Recurring_Status**
   - **Recurring_Forecasted_Date**
   - **Inspection**

   - **Site_or_Desktop**
   - **New_Control_Action_Required**
   - **Obligation_Type**
   - **Gap_Analysis**
   - **Notes_for_Gap_Analysis**

I will now attempt to generate the cleaned CSV file again. Please hold on for a moment.

```python
