# Code Review Feedback for PR #43: Move Obligation List to Procedure View

Hi @JaredStanbrook,

Thank you for your work on PR #43 addressing issue #33 to move the obligation
list functionality to the procedure view. I've reviewed your changes and am
pleased to approve this pull request.

## Summary of Changes

Your PR successfully implements several key improvements:

- Moved the obligation list from project view to procedure view
- Updated filtering mechanism from project-based to mechanism-based
- Introduced a new endpoint (`project_obligations`) for retrieving obligation
  data
- Updated views and logging messages for better consistency
- Removed the obsolete `Project.obligations` property and outdated overdue
  counting endpoints

## Key Strengths

The changes you've implemented:

1. **Improved Organization**: The obligation list now logically resides within
   the procedure view, creating a more intuitive user experience.

2. **Better Data Structure**: Changing from project-based filtering to
   mechanism-based filtering aligns better with our application architecture.

3. **Code Quality**: Your refactoring has reduced code duplication and improved
   maintainability.

4. **Consistent Style**: Good job using single quotes consistently in logging
   messages and maintaining our coding standards.

## Testing and Performance

I've tested the changes and confirmed that:

- The obligation list correctly displays in the procedure view
- Filtering by mechanism works as expected
- No regressions were introduced in related functionality
- Performance remains good with the new data retrieval approach

## Approval Decision

This PR is approved and will be merged into the codebase. Your work has
successfully resolved issue #33 and represents a significant improvement to the
Greenova application structure.

Thank you for your valuable contributions to the project. I look forward to
your continued work on Greenova.

Best regards, [Your Name]
