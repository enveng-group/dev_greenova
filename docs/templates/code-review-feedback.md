# Code Review Feedback for PR #41: Responsibility Dropdown Issue

Hi @mhahmad0,

Thank you for your work on PR #41 addressing the responsibility dropdown
functionality in the obligation form. I appreciate your effort to contribute to
the Greenova project.

## Summary of Changes

I've reviewed your submission attempting to fix the responsibility dropdown
list in the obligation CRUD form. While I understand the intent behind your
changes, I needed to make substantial revisions to resolve the issue properly.

## Key Issues Identified

After careful review, I found that:

1. **Unnecessary File Creation**: The new `responsibility/constants.py` file
   wasn't needed, as the responsibility fieldset values were already properly
   defined in `core/utils/roles.py`.

2. **Import Path Resolution**: The core issue was related to how these values
   were being imported and used in the form, not that they needed to be
   redefined elsewhere.

3. **Incomplete Fix**: While working on the dropdown list, some related issues
   remained unaddressed, particularly regarding `responsibility_id` displaying
   correctly in charts and obligation tables.

## Resolution

I've implemented a solution that:

- Properly uses the existing definitions from `core/utils/roles.py`
- Resolves the dropdown list functionality in the obligation form
- Makes minimal changes to the codebase to maintain consistency

Due to time constraints, I've had to complete the implementation myself. There
are still some issues regarding `responsibility_id` display in charts and the
obligation table that will need attention in future work.

## Moving Forward

I appreciate your willingness to tackle this issue. For future contributions, I
would recommend:

1. **Explore Existing Code**: Before creating new files or redefining
   constants, check if the functionality already exists elsewhere in the
   project.

2. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure that your changes work across all affected
   components, not just the immediate issue.

3. **Original Solutions**: While AI tools can be helpful for learning, we need
   solutions tailored to our specific codebase rather than generated code that
   might miss important context.

Due to our project timeline constraints, I may need to be more selective about
PRs that require extensive reworking in the future. However, I value your
contributions and encourage you to continue participating in the project.

Thank you again for your effort on this PR. I look forward to seeing your
future contributions to Greenova with these suggestions in mind.

Best regards, [Your Name]
