# Code Review Feedback for PR #41: Obligations Form Template

Hi @mhahmad0,

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Greenova project. After
reviewing PR #41, I need to request changes as there appear to be issues with
your submission.

## üö© Submission Issues

Your PR contains the following problems:

1. **Empty File**: The submission appears to be an empty file with no actual
   template code.

2. **Incorrect File Path**: The file path is problematic:

   ```
   pr:/workspaces/greenova/greenova/templates/workspaces/greenova/greenova/obligations/templates/obligations/form.html
   ```

   This contains duplicated directory structures and doesn't match our project
   organization.

## üö´ Critical Implementation Issues

This submission cannot be accepted for several fundamental reasons:

1. **Missing Implementation**: There's no actual template code to review or
   implement.

2. **Path Structure Issues**: Our project expects templates to be in their
   respective app directories with a clear path structure (e.g.,
   `greenova/obligations/templates/obligations/form.html`).

3. **No Accessibility Considerations**: Our project requires WCAG 2.1 AA
   standards for all templates.

4. **No Testing**: There's no evidence this template was tested with our
   existing Django project.

## üìã Our Project Requirements

As outlined in our technical documentation:

- We follow an HTML-first approach with progressive enhancement
- We prioritize WCAG 2.1 AA standards for accessibility
- We use test-driven development with Django's testing framework
- We implement proper model relationships in our database design

## üõ†Ô∏è Required Actions

To proceed with this contribution:

1. **Correct the file path**: Place your template in the proper location within
   the project structure
2. **Implement the form template**: Create a proper Django template for the
   obligations form
3. **Follow Django best practices**: Use proper template syntax for form
   rendering
4. **Address accessibility**: Ensure form elements follow our accessibility
   guidelines
5. **Test your changes**: Verify the template renders correctly with actual
   data

## ü§ù Moving Forward

I appreciate your interest in contributing to Greenova. To help you succeed
with your next submission, here are some resources:

- Review our project structure to understand the correct file organization
- Check existing templates in the project as examples of our approach
- Refer to our documentation on Django template standards and accessibility
  requirements

I'm happy to provide guidance on template implementation. Please reach out if
you have questions about our project structure or contribution guidelines.
