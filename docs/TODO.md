### Written Plan

1. **Project Overview**:
   - Define the purpose and scope of your Docker project.
   - List the main components and services that will be containerized.

2. **Technical Requirements**:
   - Specify the software and hardware requirements.
   - Detail the dependencies and configurations needed for each service.

3. **Dockerfile and Docker Compose**:
   - Create a `Dockerfile` for each service to define how the Docker image should be built.
   - Use `docker-compose.yml` to manage multi-container Docker applications.

4. **Build and Deployment Process**:
   - Outline the steps for building Docker images and running containers.
   - Include commands and scripts for automation (e.g., `build.sh`, `run.sh`).

5. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Describe the testing strategy for your Docker containers.
   - Include any tools or frameworks used for testing.

### Visual Plan

1. **Architecture Diagram**:
   - Create a visual representation of your application's architecture.
   - Show how different services interact within containers.

2. **Workflow Diagram**:
   - Illustrate the build and deployment workflow.
   - Include steps from code commit to running containers in production.

3. **Environment Diagram**:
   - Map out the different environments (development, staging, production).
   - Show how containers are deployed and managed in each environment.
