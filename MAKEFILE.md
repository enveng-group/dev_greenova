# Introduction: 

This project uses a Makefile to manage a Python virtual
environment, install dependencies, and peroform other common operations. The
goal is to improve development efficiency and ensure consistency across
different environments.

# Overview of Improvements: 

1.Defines variabiles like
VENV,PYTHON,PIP,REQUIREMENTS,CONSTRAINTS... and specifies their paths.
2.Provide the make venv command to create a Python virtual environment with one 
click.
3.Use the make install command to centrally install all project dependencies and 
upgrade pip.
4.Execute setup.py through make setup to facilitate local installation of the project.
5.Provides a make pythonstatup target to facilitate running custom Python startup scripts.
6.Proviedes the make setuptools command,which is specifically used to instal or
upgrade setuptools.
Use make clean to delete the virtual environment and temporary files generated by Python 
(such as .pyc __pycache__) in one click to ensure a clean development environment for easy 
rebuilding or packaging.


# What I learned

1.I learned how to use Makefile to automate environment configuration and dependency
installation to ensure environment consistency among team members.
2.I understand the importance of using variables in Makefile to avoid duplication
of code and make the files easier to maintain and read.
3.I realized that encapsulating common operations into make commands would allow 
myself and other team members to manage projects more efficiently and maintenance 
processes.
4.Writing documents also helped me sort out my thoughts, reflect on the entire 
process and have a clearer understanding of the logic of the project.
